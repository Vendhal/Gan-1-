### 📌 Project-1: Integrated GAN Pipeline (All Modules)
### **🔹 Overview**

**This push request integrates all individual project modules into a single, working end-to-end GAN system with training, inference, deployment, and monitoring.
All team members contributed their respective modules, and the final system was connected, stabilized, and future-proofed.**

### 👥 Team Contributions
### Module 1 – Data Preparation & Preprocessing

**_ADIRALA   THENEESHA_**

- Dataset organization and preprocessing pipeline
- Image handling and preparation for GAN training
- Future-proofed structure for dataset scalability

### Module 2 – GAN Core (Training & Inference)

**_KAMBHAMPATI SAI SANDEEP_**

- Vanilla GAN architecture implementation
- Training loop, loss handling, and inference pipeline
- Model saving/loading and reproducibility support
- Future-proofed model interfaces

### Module 3 – Model Evaluation

**_MALLINA SRI SAI LOVA TEJENDRA_**

- Evaluation logic for generated images
- Performance tracking hooks

- Code prepared for future tuning and experimentation

### Module 5 – Deployment

**_KAMBHAMPATI SAI SANDEEP_** 
**(taken over due to teammate (**_AAKASH GUMMADI_**) unavailability; faculty was informed in advance)**

- Streamlit-based deployment interface
- End-to-end inference deployment
- Packaging using src/ module structure
- Production-ready execution flow

### Module 6 – Monitoring & Logging

**_KAVALA  SAI VENKATA  SURYANARAYANA_**

- Logging of inference metadata (latency, status, requests)
- CSV-based monitoring pipeline
- Code structured for extensibility

### 🔗 Integration & Enhancements

- End-to-end integration of all modules into a single runnable system.
- Added Monitoring Dashboard (Streamlit) to visualize.
- Total requests.
- Inference latency.
- Failure counts.
- Introduced a clean src/ package architecture.
- Improved folder structure, logging, and execution reliability.
- Applied future-proofing practices across modules for scalability and maintenance.

### ✅ Notes for Evaluation

- All core project requirements are satisfied
- Additional features (dashboard, structured packaging) go beyond minimum specifications
- Contributions reflect team effort with transparent ownership
- Faculty was informed in advance about module redistribution due to absenteeism
